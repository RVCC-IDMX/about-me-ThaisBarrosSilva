    ##**Thais Barros da Silva- Final Project**
    
    About me was created with the purpose of installing the knowledge acquired from the semester on wed-development class, but attributing my own choices and creation. During the project I have a opportunity to know what I have a solid knowledge and what I will need to work more in. I used HTML5 and CSS3; during the project we went more deep than just the base, I used tags such as <img> for include imagens on my page, <a> anchor file, hyperlink on web pages, <button> for creating buttons, <input> for creating interactive controls for forms, and others. 
    I added 3 pictures from Pexels that show happiness, because that was my main idea to bring happiness for the clients. On this part of the website I created by using animation with a smooth turn of the picture
    I also add a jazz music that I dowloaded from google: https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCcUoNuI9i2O-9ejSTUj7DHg/music
      Futhermore was used CSS to bring colors and shapes to our page. During the process I researched about colors, transparency and came to the conclusion that shades of brown would be the ideal color for my website. During my research, with information brought through the book Psychology of Colors by Eva Heller, I learned that colors can show the emotion you want to convey on your page. Typically, blue is used for pages that seek to convey intelligence, the more brown tones are attributed to elegance, and it was for this research that I decided to choose the brown ones
      
   
      The following colors that I used was:


##**body color**: `#fae3c7d1` `rgba(250,227,199,0.82)`


##**main font color**:  `#000000` `rgba(0,0,0)`![colors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123126649/235391519-4bc53d7b-04ba-462d-a5e2-ef3b28c9f1dd.jpeg)


##**header and fooster** :
background-image:linear-gradient(to bottom, `#8c3d35` `rgb(140,61,53)`,`#582c28` `rgb(88,84,40)`; 

. I also added a shadow with the following box-shadow value: 2px 2px 4px 1px `#0000008e` `rgba(0 ,0.0.0.556)`;



##**H2**: The color of it was modified to brown`##964B00`as well.

##**Logo-Favicon**: I created a logo with the color based on the site's color palette (shades of brown), and I added this as png and svg. 
    
##**Picture- on CSS Animation**: display: flex, justify-content: center
            width: 280px;
            height: 250px;
            box-sizing: border-box;
            transform: translate(15px,0px);
            
  ##**First letter- on CSS Animation**:          
            #blog div p:first-child:first-letter{
            color:#592c28;
            background-image: linear-gradient(#F2d7b6,#a68c6d);
            float:left;
            font-size:4em;
            padding:.25em;
            line-height:.65em;
            text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.5);
            box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.5);
            border-top-left-radius:.3em;
            border-bottom-right-radius: .2em;
            font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
        }
        
 I used animation on the pictures from gallery.
 
 ##**Picture of Gallery oh happiness:
 .happiness1{
        transition-duration: 1000ms;
        transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
 .happiness1:hover{
        background :transparent;
        transform: rotate(20deg);
  #happiness1{
        box-sizing: border-box;
        transform: translate(100px, -10px);
 
   
##**Hero**
    I also changed the main photo, added a photo of myself using the following measurements:
       background-color:`#e9ceac`
        color: `#8e2904`
        border: `#a13c17` 4px  solid;
        text-align: center;
        padding: 4rem 2rem;
        font-size: 1rem;
        border-radius: 20px 0px;

##**where you can find me**
    At the beginning of the project, only I had added Linkedln and Instagram, at that moment I added GitHub . I used the tag <a> to connect the pages to my website 
    
 ##**Footer**: I also added a tag <a> to connect with github
 
 ##**Menu** 
 I created a hamburger menu using the picture from google resources
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet"> the code as:
  span#burguer{
    background-image: (to bottom,#582c28, #8c3d35);
    color:white;
    display:block;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px;
    cursor: pointer;
    color:#f1ddc3f4    

}

    span#burguer:hover{
    background-image: (to bottom,#582c28, #8c3d35);
    color:#f1ddc3f4;
    
    I also used JavaScript for this

  Using colors as :`#9b6660` `rgb(155,102,96)` and #ec5840 `rgb(236,88,64)`
  .box{

    align-items: center;
