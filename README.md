    About me was created with the purpose of installing the knowledge acquired during the semester, but attributing own choices and creation.

    #Logo-Favicon:
    I decided to create a logo based on the colors of the chart, black(#000000) (0,0,0) brown(#964B00), I used fivecon and the image size became 96x96png.

    #Body:
    I opted for a light color, whitesmoke (#f5f5f5) (245,245,245)and that fits the other colors too, making the customer experience comfortable

    #H2:
    The color of it was modified to brown(#964B00) as well.

    #Picture- Gallery:
    I changed the size of it as, I made smaller and I fixed it side by side using
    display: flex
    justify-content: center

    #Main picture
    I also changed the main photo, added a photo of myself using the following measurements:
    padding-top: 20px;
        width: 360px;
        border-radius: 40px;
    I added the color as well of the background lightgray (d3,d3,d3) (211,211,211)

    #where you can find me
    At the beginning of the project, only I had added Linkedln and Instagram, at that moment I added GitHub .
