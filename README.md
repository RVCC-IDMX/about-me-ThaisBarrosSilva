#Thais Barros da Silva- Final

About me was created with the purpose of installing the knowledge acquired from the semester on wed-development class, but attributing my own choices and creation. During the project I have a opportunity to know what I have a solid knowledge and what I will need to work more in. I used HTML5 and CSS3; during the project we went more deep than just the base, I used tags such as <img> for include imagens on my page, <a> anchor file, hyperlink on web pages, <button> for creating buttons, <input> for creating interactive controls for forms, and others. 
I added 3 pictures from Pexels that show happiness, because that was my main idea to bring happiness for the clients.
I also add a jazz music that I dowloaded from google: https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCcUoNuI9i2O-9ejSTUj7DHg/music



Also was used CSS to bring colors and shapes to our page. During the process I researched about colors, transparency and came to the conclusion that shades of brown would be the ideal color for my website. The following colors that I used was:
##body color: #fae3c7d1 rgba(250,227,199,0.82)

##main font color: #000000 rgba(0,0,0)

##header and fooster : background-image:linear-gradient(to bottom, #8c3d35 rgb(140,61,53),#582c28 rgb(88,84,40) . I also added a shadow with the following box-shadow value: 2px 2px 4px 1px #0000008e rgba(0 ,0.0.0.556);

##H2: The color of it was modified to brown##964B00as well.
