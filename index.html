    <h2>An Excerpt from Sherlock Holmes</h2>
    <div>
     <p>"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."</p>

    <p>"But how could you guess what the motive was?"</p>

    <p>"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.</p>

    <p>"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."</p>

    <p>"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."</p></div></article>

    <h2> CSS animation</h2>
    <p> A web page is the web developer's voice in the crowd, for it to be understood and heard the web developer must communicate in an appropriate way to the reader. Delivering content to the customer goes beyond putting information on a page, it must be well located and aligned for good organization and visualization and with attributes to draw the listener's attention.</p>
    <p> Everything starts by inserting an image in the html; once decided, it is at that moment that the functions of Cascading Style Sheets or better known as CSS are present in this journey.
     A good image can be configured in several ways and use Animation to make it more attractive to the customer.</p>
     <p>My first step was to add the picture on HTML</p>
     <picture> 
        <img class="cod1"src="img/cod1.png" alt="cod1" >
     </picture>
     <p>Than I gave the animation for it. I used : transition-duration: 1000ms and transition-timing-function: ease-in-out; </p>

     <picture>
     <img class="trans1" src="img/trans1.png" alt="trans1" width="350px" height="310px">
    </picture>
    <p>After this process I added transparence because my main idea was not change any color in this animation, also I added the dimension of rotation using: <br>
        background :transparent;<br>
        transform: rotate(35deg);
    </p>
    <picture>
        <img class="cod2" src="img/cod2.png" alt="trans1" width="400px" height="100px">
       </picture>
       <p>After adding these four possible characteristics for CSS transporations the image was rotated by 35 deg. with a duration of 100ms and with the ease-in-out function, that is basically the transition starts quickly and gradually slows down until the end</p>

       <picture>
        <img class="trans2" src="img/trans2.png" alt="trans2" width="350px" height="310px">
